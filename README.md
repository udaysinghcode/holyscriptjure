# Holy Scriptjure

## Proposal

### Motivation
Over the last several years, the web has shifted in both terms of interaction
design and web browser functionality. The modern web has shifted from static
pages from the past thus demanding a [system][1] which provides reactions based
on data changes. This necessity for real time interaction has lead to the
development of single page applications and shift in the world of rapid
prototyping from monolithic web frameworks to a clear separation between single
page applications and APIs.

The development of Node.js, a Javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 Javascript
engine has led to more developers embracing Javascript as a viable language for
backend development. Despite its popularity however, the syntax of Javascript,
the mutability of objects, and its complexity regarding callbacks makes it
slightly difficult to write code where the user is completely aware of their
code and its side effects.
